I used free APIs from Spoonacular to get requests for wine matching the food that user inputs.
Also I used POST method using json-data and json-schema as well as tv4 validation if user wants to add his wine suggestion
I used Node.js, Express, HTML and CSS to create both frontend and backend of the application
